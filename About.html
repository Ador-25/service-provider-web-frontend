             Pesha.com is a web-based platform which aims to connect people who are searching for part-timed jobs
 with small businesses/restaurants/coffee shops who look forward to instant recruits for any time period.
 There is a growing concern about rising unemployment as the population is on the rise, people of all
 ages look forward to contribute a hand in their household through any kind of part time job. This is not
 only a concern for part-timers, many full-time employees/corporate workers also agree to the fact that
 part-time jobs may have a positive impact on their mental peace and might get them better wages by
 working hourly. Pesha.com aims to compile any part-time opportunities/offers for people who register
 themselves as recruits through the platform and connect them to the business who put up the job
 offers.
